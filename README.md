# IJC437---Post-Pandemic Rail Demand Recovery in Great Britain

## Project Overview
This project investigates how rail passeneger demand across Great Britain has recovered following the COVID-19 pandemic. Using regional flow data from the Office of Rail and Road (ORR), the analysis examines structural differences between within-region and cross-border travel.

## Research Question
1. How have within-region and cross-border rail passenger journeys across Great Britain changed over the period of 1995 to 2024?'
2. Do within-region rail passenger journeys display different growth and recovery patterns compared to cross-border journeys between England, Scotland and Wales?
3. How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect the rail passenger journeys and is there evidence that rising real-term fares are associated with differences in post-pandemic recovery between domestic and cross-border travel?

## Key Findings
- Rail demand exhibits a clear "two-speed" recovery.
- Domestic journeys recover faster than cross-border routes.
- Statistical testing confirms recovery differences are significant.
- Structural factors dominate over fare-based explanations.
